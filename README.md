Watch <a href="https://jenniferslagt.github.io/vue-weather-app/"> here </a>

## Description
The weather app is a small app in which you have actually one main functionality: searching for a location and displaying the weather about that location. This app is made with the Vue.js framework and the Open Weather API. 

## Vue.js
Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces and based on Node.js. Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only, so it's formally made for Front-Enders. Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance's data.  

## Open Weather API

## Learning goals
The main goal on this small weather app is to learn Vue.js, this is what I've done: 
* I've learned what Vue.js is and how it works.
* I understand how data and methods work.
* You can bind data and make it dynamic.
* I know how events work. 
* I understand how events modifiers work and learnt about keyboard events.
* I understand how two-way data binding works between the parent (Vue.js) and its components.
* Props are used for data from the parent to the component(s).
* You can use $emit and $on to send data from the child and receive it on the child.
* I understand how to use conditional states. 
* You can toggle CSS classes based on the dynamic data.

In short: this project was focused on working with components and dynamic data with Vue.js.
